It was the first time I truly contemplated death, the idea that every life was finite, and the possibility that what we did with our time mattered a great deal. I cried when I read this passage as a kid, and I still get choked up when I read it today. Charlotte's Web taught me the power of a good story. And, of course, the fact that Charlotte used writing to change lives had a powerful impact on me as a future novelist!

When I gave my speech, nobody clapped. Worse, Sister Kathleen pulled me from class. I thought I was in trouble, until she brought me into the class next door and had me deliver the speech again.""

Ann Beattie has been included in four O. Henry Award collections and John Updike's Best American Short Stories of the Century.
She received the prestigious PEN/Malamud Award and the Rea Award for
the Short Story. She has written seven novels and eight collections of
stories and publishes frequently in The New Yorker. Scribner will publish Walks with Men in June.

In Playing to the Bear,
exclusive for Kindle, the narrator finds herself standing with
Jamie--her ex-boyfriend's stepdaughter--in the apartment she'd
practically lived in so many years before. The apartment had very
little furniture now, and the floors gleam unnaturally. Jamie, now a
lovely young woman, had begged her to come because she wanted one of
the adults in her life to tell her every secret, every subtext after
the fact. She thought the filled-in knowledge would keep her standing,
and able to decipher the real meaning of things.

""Blockade Billy"" tells the story of William ""Blockade Billy"" Blakely. He may have been the greatest baseball player the game has ever seen, but today no one remembers his name. He was the first--and only--player to have his existence completely removed from the record books. Even his team is long forgotten, barely a footnote in the game's history. 

Blockade Billy has a secret darker than any pill or injection that might cause a scandal in sports today. His secret was much, much worse... and only Stephen King can reveal the truth to the world, once and for all.
